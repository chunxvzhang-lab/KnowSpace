/**
 * The companion file that holds what a Markdown document cannot.
 *
 * A document stays the source of truth for the tree; this file is for everything
 * a tree cannot say, starting with the notes hanging off nodes. Four rules make
 * it safe to have a second file at all, and each of them is a rule because the
 * alternative goes wrong in a way that costs the reader their writing:
 *
 * 1. **The document wins.** Nothing here can change the tree, so a stale or
 *    hand-edited companion cannot corrupt the outline — at worst it decorates
 *    it oddly.
 * 2. **Missing or unreadable means less, not broken.** A companion that is
 *    absent, empty, or replaced by garbage opens as a plain tree. The map is a
 *    view of the document first and a store of extras second.
 * 3. **Unknown is kept.** A companion written by a newer version carries
 *    sections this one has never heard of; they are written back exactly as they
 *    were read, so opening a document in an older build cannot destroy what that
 *    build does not understand.
 * 4. **Written only when the reader changes something.** Loading never rewrites
 *    the file, so a document that is merely opened gains nothing and loses
 *    nothing.
